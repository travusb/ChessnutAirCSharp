# ChessnutAirCSharp
Chessnut's EasyLinkSDK wrapped in C#.

I've includes the easylink.dll as an embedded resource that copies to the correct location if it's missing.
The easylink.dll is compiled for windows. You can replace the embedded file with your own or just put your own dll in the running directory.
